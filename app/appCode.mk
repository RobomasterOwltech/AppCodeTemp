# This file contains compilation instructions of the application and FreeRTOS.
# THIS IS NOT A STANDALONE MAKE FILE. 
# ==========================================
# Possible improvements:
# * Make for an easy way to change the heap type 
# * Set a variable for when the processor has a Memory Protected Unit

# I knew what to put in here from the folowing sources:
# https://www.freertos.org/Documentation/01-FreeRTOS-quick-start/01-Beginners-guide/03-Build-your-first-project
## Only 3 source files that are common to all RTOS ports, 
## and one microcontroller specific source file are required, 
## and its API is designed to be simple and intuitive.
# Required Source files
# * FreeRTOS/Source/tasks.c
# * FreeRTOS/Source/queue.c
# * FreeRTOS/Source/list.c
# * FreeRTOS/Source/portable/[compiler]/[architecture]/port.c.
# * FreeRTOS/Source/portable/MemMang/heap_x.c where 'x' is 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.
# Required Header files
# * FreeRTOS/Source/include
# * FreeRTOS/Source/portable/[compiler]/[architecture].
# * Whichever directory contains the FreeRTOSConfig.h file to be used - see the Configuration File paragraph below.
# * Depending on the port, it may also be necessary for the same directories to be in the assembler's include path.
