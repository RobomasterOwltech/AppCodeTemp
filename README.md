# AppCodeTemp
Template to create FreeRTOS tasks using the team's middleware

-------------------------------------------------------------------

## How to use this repo:

1. Clone it `git clone git@github.com:RobomasterOwltech/AppCodeTemp.git`
2. Go into the newly generated directory `cd AppCodeTemp`
1. Download the submodules `git submodule init && git submodule update`
1. In case any of the dependencies needs to be updated, simply do: `git submodule update --remote`

## Having problems with git?:

* Make sure that `postStartCommand` value is set at the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.
* Make sure to have created and register ssh keys for Github, as done in [DeployTools](https://github.com/RobomasterOwltech/deployTools)

## How to change DevBoard

1. At the moment you clone the repo, modify the branch for the `robotConfig` repo.
        1. This will Change the defines on the `Makefile`
1. Change the OwlDefines variables at `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json`

## Create the container

1. Download docker:  
        - For Linux: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/  
        - For Windows: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/  
        - For MacOS: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/  
2. From the project root folder (AppCodeTemp) go to ".devcontainer": `cd .devcontainer`
3. Build the image: `docker build .`
4. List the images:  `docker images`
        - Identify the ID of the image just built
5. Go to the project root folder (AppCodeTemp): `cd ..`
6. Run the container in detach mode:  `docker run -d --mount type=bind,source=$(realpath ./),target=/home/myProjects <YOUR_IMAGE_ID>` # Source is the absoluthe path to AppCodeTemp

> All compilation steps need to be done form inside the container. To enter it:
> 1. List containers: `docker ps`
>         - Identify the ID of the container
> 2. Enter the container: `docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> bash`

## Compile:

1. From the project root folder (AppCodeTemp) call make 

        make all
    1. You might need to specify the compiler path, in which case use:
        
            make GCC_PATH=/path/2/compiler
    
    1. Alternatively, you can add it to your path, or set it as an environment variable. 
1. If your build failed, then you can clean the `build` folder
        
        make clean
1. If you are encountering problems, and would like to know what is being configured by the makefiles from other projects, try:

        make showRobotConfig showRtosConfig

### Add a file to be compiled 

1. Save your changes to the file.
1. Copy it's relative path.
1. If it is a C, add it in the `C_SOURCES` variable from the `Makefile` 
1. In case your file is referencing any library, make sure it is present in the `C_INCLUDES`

## NOTES:

### C/C++ standard
If you were to change the C/C++ standard used, remember to change it in the `IntelliSense`, `makefile`, and `c_cpp_properties.json`
